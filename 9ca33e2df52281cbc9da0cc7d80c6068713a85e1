      "message": "My last attempted libyuv roll in Chrome showed linker or compilation errors on Android, Fuchsia, macOS, and Windows:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5775949\n\nSo Linux, ChromeOS, and iOS have not been eliminated. Since iOS is similar to macOS, I think it is likely to have the same linker errors as macOS. So only Linux and ChromeOS remain. I decided to restrict `libyuv_use_sme` to just Linux.\n\nI will try to roll to this comment in Chrome. If this still fails, then I am afraid that we will need to set `libyuv_use_sme` to `false` on all platforms until we have fixed the Chrome build errors.",
