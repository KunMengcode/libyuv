      "message": "thanks for the contribution.  It should have a test, and bump the version number so the user can see the new api and do ifdef in their code to maintain backwards compatability if they want.\nBut thats okay... I can add those (see the I010ToNV12)\n\nTo do this efficiently, I\u0027d look to see if there is already a Merge16To8 row function.  If not, either write one, or do a row buffer that does 2 row functions - Convert16To8 and MergeUV\nBut I can get that in a followup CL and benchmark to show the improvement.",
